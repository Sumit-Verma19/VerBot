Overview

VerBot is an NLP-powered chatbot designed to facilitate daily tasks by responding to both spoken and typed commands. The system is designed to learn user preferences over time, retaining command history and preferences in a SQL database to provide a seamless, adaptive user experience. VerBot also leverages asynchronous processing for handling concurrent commands, ensuring a quick response time.

Features

	•	Multi-Modal Interaction: VerBot supports both voice and text input, allowing users to interact in their preferred mode.
	•	Personalized Responses: Retains user preferences and interaction history, tailoring responses based on past interactions.
	•	Voice Recognition: Integrates speech recognition for hands-free interactions, allowing for voice commands.
	•	Real-Time Processing: Asynchronous programming with Python’s asyncio allows VerBot to handle multiple commands concurrently.
	•	SQL Database Management: Stores user preferences, command history, and relevant data for personalization.
	•	Natural Language Processing: Uses NLP libraries like spaCy and NLTK for advanced command parsing and response generation.

Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/VerBot.git
cd VerBot


	2.	Create a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Database Setup:
	•	Ensure SQL is installed and set up on your local machine.
	•	Run the provided SQL scripts to initialize the necessary tables and data.
	5.	Environment Variables:
	•	Create a .env file to store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information as needed.

Usage

	1.	Run VerBot:

python main.py


	2.	Interacting with VerBot:
	•	Text Input: Type commands directly in the interface.
	•	Voice Input: Activate the voice mode and speak commands for a hands-free experience.
	3.	Sample Commands:
	•	Text: “What’s the weather today?”
	•	Voice: “Set a reminder for tomorrow at 9 AM.”

Tech Stack

	•	Python: Core programming language.
	•	NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK for command parsing and language processing.
	•	Speech Recognition: speech_recognition library for handling voice commands.
	•	Database: SQL for storing user preferences, history, and settings.
	•	Asynchronous Processing: Python’s asyncio library for handling concurrent requests.
	•	Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3 for audio feedback.
